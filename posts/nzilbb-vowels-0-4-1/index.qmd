The `nzilbb.vowels` R package has just been updated on  
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nzilbb.vowels/index.html). 

The main things to note are the inclusion of a series of functions for handling
rotation of principal components. The functions (`pca_rotate_2d()` and
`pca_rotate_procrustes()`) modify the results of `prcomp()` or `princomp()`.
The benefit of this is that the functions should plug directly into existing PCA 
workflows. That is, any plots or summaries you were producing from the PCA
done with `prcomp()` or `princomp()` should work exactly as before. The 
drawback is that you need to be careful that you don't mislead readers in to 
thinking the rotated PCs are the original PCs. Indeed, rotated PCs **are no**
**longer PCs at all**. I tend to say "Component 1" rather than "Principal
Component 1" to mark this distinction. 

For more details see the new article on the package website [here](file:///Users/jbl91/UC%20Enterprise%20Dropbox/Joshua%20Wilson%20Black/projects/nzilbb.vowels/docs/articles/Rotation.html). 
These are rough notes, before I head off for parental leave!

The experimental `mds_test()` function now takes dissimilarity matrices rather
than similarity matrices (to match the standard use of `smacof::smacofSym()`).

Finally, I've added a workshop on the 'model-to-PCA' workflow we often use this
package for. Read it [here](file:///Users/jbl91/UC%20Enterprise%20Dropbox/Joshua%20Wilson%20Black/projects/nzilbb.vowels/docs/articles/Model-to-PCA-workflow.html)
