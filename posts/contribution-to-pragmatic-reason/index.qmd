A volume in honour of Christopher Hookway is currently in the works edited
by Robert Talisse, Paniel Reyes Cárdenas, and Daniel Herbert. I've contributed a
piece on Chris's account of Peirce's metaphysics, especially as it appeals to
'common sense'.

On Chris's view, metaphysics articulates those features of common sense or 
instinct which are appealed to (often implicitly) in the generation of 
scientific hypotheses. Importantly, Chris takes it that the role of common 
sense diminishes as sciences develop. We might, then, expect the need for 
metaphysics to reduce over time (perhaps being replaced by... physics).

I argue that Chris's emphasis on Peirce's appeals to common sense
_belief_ hides Peirce's more fundamental appeal to common _experience_. I 
emphasise Peirce's notion of the 'scientific intelligence', or anything which 
can learn from experience (CP2.229, c. 1897). By abstraction, we make fallible
claims about features of experience _common_ to any scientific intelligence. This
is the source of the strong modal claims which Peirce makes in his logic and
metaphysics. I argue that common sense beliefs are only interesting for Peirce
insofar as they give us access to common experience.
