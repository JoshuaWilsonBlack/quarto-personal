## The Problem

I am attempting to build a nice illustrative example of PCA which shows how 
it can produce interpretable, lower-dimensional representations of vowel formant
data. 

One [well](https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-principal-component-analysis-explained-visually-in-5-minutes-20ce8a9ebf0f)-[trodden](https://towardsdatascience.com/principal-component-analysis-pca-explained-visually-with-zero-math-1cbf392b9e7d) [method](https://machinelearningmastery.com/principal-component-analysis-for-visualization/) of showing how PCA works is to start with three dimensions and go down to two dimensions.

Heavy use of `ggplot2` for the last year and a half has worn deep grooves into
my brain. But `ggplot2` does not offer options for 3D plots.

A few extension packages exist to extend `ggplot` into three dimensions, but
nothing stood out to me as I was looking around. I have also wanted to explore
`plotly` a little more after playing around with `plotly` cytoscapes for 
[another project](https://nz-newspaper-philosophy.herokuapp.com/).

The following example, which will be used for a larger project on PCA in the
study of vowel covariation, took far more work than anticipated. I'll present 
it in the next section and then run through some of the problems which occurred
for me.

## A Plotly Example

Here's the code, with the Plotly interactive following.

``` {r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Reorganising data

load('onze_means.rda')

onze_sub <- onze_means %>%
  filter(
    vowel %in% c("DRESS", "KIT", "TRAP")
  ) %>%
  select(
    speaker, vowel, F1_50, yob, gender
  )

onze_to_pca <- onze_sub %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = vowel,
    values_from = F1_50
  )

# Running PCA

onze_pca <- prcomp(
  onze_to_pca %>% select(DRESS, KIT, TRAP),
  scale=FALSE
)

# Extracting PCA information

# Load scores for individuals (contained in onze_pca$x)
onze_to_pca <- onze_to_pca %>%
  mutate(
    PC1 = onze_pca$x[, 1],
    PC2 = onze_pca$x[, 2]
  )

# Extract centre. This will be used in the plot.
pca_center <- onze_pca$center

center_tibble <- tibble(
  "DRESS" = pca_center[[1]],
  "KIT" = pca_center[[2]],
  "TRAP" = pca_center[[3]]
)

# Extract loadings.
pca_loadings <- onze_pca$rotation

# Use the loadings and centre to find where each point sits along PC1 and PC2
# when represented in the original 3D space.
onze_to_pca <- onze_to_pca %>%
  mutate(
    PC1_DRESS = (PC1 * pca_loadings[1, 1]) + pca_center[[1]],
    PC1_KIT = (PC1 * pca_loadings[2, 1]) + pca_center[[2]],
    PC1_TRAP = (PC1 * pca_loadings[3, 1]) + pca_center[[3]],
    PC2_DRESS = (PC2 * pca_loadings[1, 2]) + pca_center[[1]],
    PC2_KIT = (PC2 * pca_loadings[2, 2]) + pca_center[[2]],
    PC2_TRAP = (PC2 * pca_loadings[3, 2]) + pca_center[[3]],
  )

# Visualisation

fig <- plot_ly(
  data = onze_to_pca,
  x = ~DRESS,
  y = ~KIT,
  z = ~TRAP,
  type = "scatter3d", # What kind of plot.
  mode = "markers", # What kind of marking (something like geom in ggplot)
  name = "Speakers", # This label will go in the legend.
  marker = list(
    size = 2,
    opacity = 0.8,
    color = "gray",
    lines = list(
      color = 'black',
      width = 1
    ),
    showlegend = FALSE
  )
)

# Add title and axis labels
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    margin = list(
      t = 90
    ),
    title = list(
      text = "Mean KIT, DRESS, and TRAP F1 for 100 ONZE Speakers",
      font = list(
        size = 24,
        family = "Open Sans"
      )
    ),
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(
        title = "DRESS F1 (Hz)"
      ),
      yaxis = list(
        title = "KIT F1 (Hz)"
      ),
      zaxis = list(
        title = "TRAP F1 (Hz)"
      )
    )
  )

fig <- fig %>%
  # Add centre mark
  add_trace(
    x = ~DRESS,
    y = ~KIT,
    z = ~TRAP,
    data = center_tibble,
    type = 'scatter3d',
    mode = 'markers',
    marker = list(
      size = 6,
      opacity = 1,
      color = 'red',
      symbol = "x"
      ),
    name = "Center",
    inherit = FALSE
  ) %>%
  # Add PC1 line
  add_trace(
    data = onze_to_pca,
    x = ~PC1_DRESS,
    y = ~PC1_KIT,
    z = ~PC1_TRAP,
    type = 'scatter3d',
    mode = 'lines',
    name = 'PC1',
    line = list(
      color = "#D55E00",
      width = 6
    ),
    inherit = FALSE
  ) %>%
  # Add PC2 line.
  add_trace(
    data = onze_to_pca,
    x = ~PC2_DRESS,
    y = ~PC2_KIT,
    z = ~PC2_TRAP,
    type = 'scatter3d',
    mode = 'lines',
    name = 'PC2',
    line = list(
      color = "#0072B2",
      width = 4
    ),
    inherit = FALSE
  ) %>%
  layout(
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(
        title = "DRESS F1 (Hz)"
      ),
      yaxis = list(
        title = "KIT F1 (Hz)"
      ),
      zaxis = list(
        title = "TRAP F1 (Hz)"
      )
    )
  )

```
The plot above can be rotated with the mouse and the legend on the right allows
for different plot elements to be turned off. Double click 'Speakers' to see
just the points for each speaker.

What are these elements?

- The points are the mean first formant values for 
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">dress</span>,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">trap</span>, and
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">kit</span>
for 100 speakers from the Origins of New Zealand English (ONZE) corpus.
- The 'Center' is the centre of the cloud of points.
- PC1 shows the first principal component derived from the data.
- PC2 shows the second principal component.

The idea here is to explain PCA in three dimensions as putting a cross in the 
centre of a cloud of points and then drawing the straight line which captures
the most variation in the data. That is, to draw the straight line which is 
'inside' the cloud of points for as much of its length as possible. We then
create the second PC, by finding the line at right angles to the first line 
which captures the most possible variance.

The data can then be plotted against these two lines rather than the original
three dimensions and the same idea extends to cases when we have many many more
variables than three.

Ideally, the principal components are _interpretable_. In this case, the first
PC is a line from small values of all three variables to large values. That is,
we can interpret it as capturing something like vocal tract length. Speakers
with long vocal tracts tend to have lower first formant values. 

The second formant is also interpretable. The ONZE corpus contains speakers born
in the mid-nineteenth century all the way through to the 1980's. In this time,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">dress</span> and
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">trap</span> have raised, while
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">kit</span> has lowered. The line for
PC2 (the blue line), runs from high values of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">dress</span> and
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">trap</span> and low values of 
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">kit</span> to 
low values of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">dress</span> and
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">trap</span> and high values of 
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">kit</span>. That is, it captures the
structure in our data which comes from the structured change in vowel spaces
which has occurred over time in New Zealand English.

## Lessons Learned

I have not found the `plotly` documentation for R to be very easy to get my head
into.

A few things which caused me trouble and might help you:

- `plotly` is not 'surly'. Surliness is a feature of the `tidyverse` packages: they complain. If you add an argument to a `plotly` function which it doesn't 
recognise, it will often just ignore it without telling you. This is not great
for people who like to use 'colour' rather than 'color' or 'grey' rather than 'gray'.
- Often an initial plot is made with `plot_ly()` and then additional features are 
added to the plot with `add_trace()`. In this case, the points are added to the
plot at the `plot_ly()` stage, and the lines and the red cross added using `add_trace()`.
The first argument to `plot_ly()` is a data frame, but this is not the case for
`add_trace()`. I have found being explicit by saying `data = onze_to_pca` rather
than just having `plot_ly(onze_to_pca ...)`, avoids confusion. It took me a long
time to work out why my `add_trace(onze_to_pca)` was not functioning.
- If the added element is different in `type` from the original plot, it is 
vital to add `inherit = FALSE` to any `add_trace()` calls. My initial attempts
to add lines to the plot added both lines _and_ points ('markers' in `plotly` speak)
because I failed to add `inherit = FALSE`.
- Axis labelling for 3D plots occurs by modifying the `scene` rather than `xaxis`
or `yaxis` etc. directly. See the call to `layout()` in the plot code.

It may be that there are obvious solutions to some of these problems. If so,
please let me know!
