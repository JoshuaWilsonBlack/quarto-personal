Kia ora, my name is Joshua Wilson Black. I am a lecturer at the New Zealand 
Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour. 

My research crosses linguistics, philosophy, and digital humanities. I am
particularly interested in the use of large corpora to understand sign usage
in many varieties and across a range of temporal scales using contempoary
statistical methods. In all my work 
I try to live up to ['open science'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) 
principles.

::: callout-note

'Wilson Black' is my surname. Sometimes I am incorrectly cited as 'Black, Joshua
Wilson'. This is unfortunate but unavoidable! I also have a handful of earlier
(pre-marriage) publications under the name 'Black'. To make matters even more
confusing, I have occasionally thrown my middle name ('David') in to the mix.

:::

My current research interests include:

- the quantitative identification of clusters of co-varying phonetic variables in the ONZE and QuakeBox corpora of New Zealand English, and
- identifying participants and themes in intellectual life in digitised historical newspapers.

From 2024, I am teaching a series of workshops on R, statistics, and open
science methods. These are targeted at advanced students and NZILBB-affiliated
researchers, but are open to all. The materials for the workshops are available
[here](https://nzilbb.github.io/statistics_workshops/) and are constantly
evolving. I'm very happy to receive any feedback on these materials.

My PhD was in philosophy and centred on the work of Charles Peirce and this
remains a significant interest. My 
non-standard introduction to statistics came through trying to understand
how statistical ideas functioned in Peirce's metaphysics and philosophy of 
science. I have since updated my
statistical and computational knowledge with a graduate degree in data science.
Nonetheless, both the 'what' of my research --- the quantitative investigation of
sign use --- and the 'how' --- open science practices --- remain Peircean in spirit.
